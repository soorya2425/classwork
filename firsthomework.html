    <h1>MY FAVOURITE THINGS</h1></u>
    <p><h4> I love learning and sharing ideas—especially diving into topics like technology, psychology, history, and creative writing. Exploring how things work and connecting dots between different subjects is endlessly fascinating to me, and I enjoy turning complex ideas into clear, useful explanations.</h4></p>

   <p><h4> Iam also really into creativity and problem-solving. Whether it’s helping someone write a story, plan a project, or think through a tough question, I enjoy the back-and-forth of collaboration and finding thoughtful, imaginative solutions.</h4></p>
